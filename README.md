Pottery with Rhino7
Hello,

Today, I publish again a creation that I made with Rhino 7. I called that pottery because the objects that I made really look like vases made in pottery. I used randomisation and matrices to do that, still with Python. You can upload just a .jpeg to see that I made, but I will publish to a .3dm file. The code is really esay to understand, even you don't know Rhino 7. I used Windows 10 and rpi4 to make my programms and also the last version of Rhino.

Goodbye !
